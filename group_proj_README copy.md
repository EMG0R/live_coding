I really appreciate you arranging this type of opportuinty for us, I can't imagine a better incentive to learn something like mini tidal so quickly. The group dynamics felt a lot like being in Matthew Davidson's modular ensmeble where we had to designate before and on the spot who would be filling which instrument role which is usually pre-determined in an acoustic environment. I really enjoyed the challenge of this type of spontanious team work even though it was socially dificult sometimes to communicate what I thouhgt would sound best for the group. I think I learned a lot and hope to peform in a group setting like this in the future ASAP.
