# TIDAL CYCLES ASSIGNMENT


 I can't find a description of what this assignment is supposed to be but I assume its to turn in the patch we were working on.
 
 
 stack [
slow 2 $ note "c g/2 d/3 a/4" # pan (rand) # s "moog",
slow 2 $ note "e b/2" # pan (rand) # s "juno",
s "bd*4?",
s "sd/2",
s "glasstap*14?" # pan (rand) # gain 1.2,
s "glitch/4" # n "4 6 7" # pan (rand) # gain 0.7 
] 


My patch isn't too complicated but it does represent my priorities I think. I was particularlty inspired by people using self-oscillating type stuff, that is definitely what I will focus on this week.
