# PROJECT PROPOSAL


I would like to do research into the coolest current usecases and potential of the wrapper object RNBO within max/msp

https://rnbo.cycling74.com/

I've used it in the past to do some basic web-based synthesis but I think I have no real idea of the potential it presents. I've heard certain people say it's just a shortcut if you aren't good enough in C to do what you want in the real world but I think the visual nature of it and ability to export the same code for a variety of different situations makes it really valueble and worth a deeper look. I can definitely look into someting more documented since its so new and I don't remember seeing any live-coding performances with it but I think it has the potential to be useful for that and so many other things I'm interested in.
